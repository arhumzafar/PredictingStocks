## Stock Prediction using various methods - STAT 453
<br>
<br>
This project was made for STAT 453: Deep Learning in Spring 2020. <br>
<br>
In this project, my group members: [Desmond Fung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/desmond-fung) and [Guk Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guk-kim-b74933199) and I
do an analysis on how Recurrent Neural Networks using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can be used to attemptm to predict the stock market.
Additionally, we also pursue a second analysis comparing several simpler machine learning model's abilities to predict stock prices given a dataset
of a stock's prior behavior. This project utilizes *PyTorch & sci-kit learn* heavily, while also running on the *quandl and stockAI* Python packages that grant us access to accurate stock data.
