## Stock Prediction using various methods - STAT 453
<br>
<br>
This project was made for 
**STAT 453: Deep Learning in Spring 2020**. <br>
<br>
In this project, my group members: 
[Desmond Fung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/desmond-fung),
[Guk Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guk-kim-b74933199)
and I do an analysis on how Recurrent Neural Networks using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can be used to attemptm to predict the stock market.
Additionally, we also pursue a second analysis comparing several simpler machine learning model's abilities to predict stock prices given a dataset
of a stock's prior behavior. The analysis is followed by a discussion on the interconnectedness of the stock market and how we may not have currently have the means to use machine learning and deep learning applications to accurately predict the stock market.

This project utilizes *PyTorch & sci-kit learn* heavily, while also running on the *quandl and stockAI* Python packages that grant us access to accurate stock data.
